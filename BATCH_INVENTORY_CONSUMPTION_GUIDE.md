## Example Workflow

### Pickle Production Batch
**Batch**: "Spicy Pickle Batch #001"

**Inventory Consumed**:
- Tomatoes: 50kg √ó Rs.80/kg = Rs.4,000
- Onions: 20kg √ó Rs.60/kg = Rs.1,200
- Spices Mix: 5kg √ó Rs.200/kg = Rs.1,000
- Vinegar: 10L √ó Rs.50/L = Rs.500
- **Total Inventory Cost**: Rs.6,700

## Benefits

### 1. **Complete Cost Tracking**
- Know exactly what raw materials cost per batch
- Track inventory usage patterns
- Identify cost optimization opportunities

### 2. **Inventory Management**
- Prevent over-consumption with stock validation
- Real-time inventory updates
- Better planning for future batches

### 3. **Profit Analysis**
- Compare total batch costs (inventory + other expenses) vs. income
- Track profit margins per batch
- Make data-driven pricing decisions

## Database Schema

The system creates these tables:
- `batch_inventory_consumption`: Tracks consumption per batch
- `batch_inventory_details`: View with detailed consumption info
- `batch_cost_summary`: Cost analysis per batch

## Integration

- **Inventory System**: Automatically reduces physical stock
- **Accounting System**: Links consumption to batch costs
- **Reporting**: Provides cost analysis and profit tracking

## Best Practices

1. **Record consumption immediately** after production
2. **Use accurate quantities** - measure what you actually use
3. **Add descriptive notes** for future reference
4. **Review costs regularly** to optimize production
5. **Keep inventory levels updated** to prevent stockouts

## Troubleshooting

### "Insufficient Stock" Error
- Check current inventory levels
- Add more stock if needed
- Verify quantities are correct

### Missing Inventory Items
- Ensure items are added to inventory first
- Check if items are marked as active
- Verify proper categorization

### Cost Calculations
- Unit costs are auto-filled from inventory
- Can be adjusted for specific batches
- Total cost = quantity √ó unit cost
