# Supabase Storage Setup for Product Images

This guide will help you set up Supabase Storage to handle product image uploads for your Himalayan Flavours Hub.

## 1. Create Storage Bucket

### Step 1: Navigate to Storage in Supabase Dashboard
1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Click on "Storage" in the left sidebar
3. Click "Create a new bucket"

### Step 2: Configure the Bucket
- **Bucket name**: `product-images`
- **Public bucket**: ‚úÖ Check this (so images can be accessed publicly)
- **File size limit**: Set to `5MB` (or your preferred limit)
- **Allowed MIME types**: `image/*` (allows all image types)

### Step 3: Create the Bucket
Click "Create bucket" to finalize the setup.

## 2. Configure Storage Policies

### Step 1: Go to Storage Policies
1. In the Storage section, click on your `product-images` bucket
2. Click on "Policies" tab

### Step 2: Create Upload Policy
Create a policy that allows authenticated users to upload images:

```sql
-- Policy name: Allow authenticated users to upload images
-- Operation: INSERT
-- Target roles: authenticated
-- Policy definition:
(auth.role() = 'authenticated')
```

### Step 3: Create Read Policy
Create a policy that allows public read access to images:

```sql
-- Policy name: Allow public read access to images
-- Operation: SELECT
-- Target roles: public
-- Policy definition:
(true)
```

### Step 4: Create Delete Policy
Create a policy that allows authenticated users to delete their uploaded images:

```sql
-- Policy name: Allow authenticated users to delete images
-- Operation: DELETE
-- Target roles: authenticated
-- Policy definition:
(auth.role() = 'authenticated')
```

## 3. Update Database Schema

Run the updated schema from `supabase-content-schema.sql` in your Supabase SQL Editor to add the `image` field to products.

## 4. Test Image Upload

### Step 1: Go to Admin Panel
1. Navigate to your admin panel (`/admin`)
2. Click on the "üìù Content" tab
3. Scroll down to the Products section

### Step 2: Upload an Image
1. Find a product in the list
2. Click "üìÅ Choose Image" in the Product Image section
3. Select an image file from your computer
4. The image should upload and display a preview

### Step 3: Verify Storage
1. Go back to Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí Storage ‚Üí product-images bucket
2. You should see your uploaded image in the `products/` folder

## 5. Image Storage Structure

Images are stored with the following naming convention:
```
products/{productId}-{timestamp}.{extension}
```

Example:
```
products/1-1703123456789.jpg
products/temp-1703123456789.png
```

## 6. Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Bucket not found" error
- Ensure the bucket name is exactly `product-images`
- Check that the bucket was created successfully

### Issue: "Policy violation" error
- Verify that storage policies are correctly configured
- Ensure you're logged in as an authenticated user

### Issue: Images not displaying
- Check that the bucket is set as public
- Verify the image URL is accessible in browser
- Check browser console for CORS errors

### Issue: Upload fails
- Check file size (should be under 5MB)
- Verify file type is an image
- Check browser console for error messages

## 7. Security Considerations

- **Public Access**: Images are publicly accessible, so don't upload sensitive content
- **File Validation**: Consider adding client-side file validation for size and type
- **Rate Limiting**: Monitor upload frequency to prevent abuse
- **Cleanup**: Implement cleanup procedures for unused images

## 8. Advanced Features (Optional)

### Image Optimization
Consider implementing:
- Image compression before upload
- Multiple image sizes (thumbnail, medium, large)
- WebP format conversion for better performance

### CDN Integration
For better performance, consider:
- Setting up a CDN for image delivery
- Using Supabase's built-in CDN features

## 9. Environment Variables

Ensure your `.env.local` file has the correct Supabase credentials:

```env
REACT_APP_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
REACT_APP_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```
